# Where to put green infrastructure

Humphrey students presented on the fact that there are lots of variables to consider when selecting geographic areas where green roofs (or other green infrastructure). The students looked at a suite of variables, and established clear cut-off zones for determining which tracts where greenroofs could have a disproportionate benefit. For instance, tracts where the average summer temperature on a hot day was >= 95 degrees, and tracts must be an "area of concentrated poverty." 

<br>
Leveraging the continuous nature of these variable rather than binning them into "suitable for green roofs" versus "not suitable" could be a way to give a bit more nuance into the conversation. Here, explore the full range of summer temperatures, or percent of people within a tract whose income is in the bottom 20% of the region. By synthesize these disparate variables into a single, understandable value, we can identify the tracts where greenroofs could have the largest disproportionate benefit. And also compare the differences in "how much better" is one tract versus another.

Here we've centered and re-scaled all the variables, so they all have the same units. Please scroll down to start using this tool. We suggest you use a desktop web browser for the best experience.

This is totally a quick and dirty test to see if this works. All variables used here are pulled from the Equity Considerations Dataset and informed by the student presentation on Tuesday. If this seems like a useful approach (synthesizing the different variables by using standardized and scaled values), let's think more critically about what the data inputs should be!
