# Welcome to the Economic Values Atlas

Brookings Institution pioneered an Economic Values Atlas in 2019 for the
Portland Metro region
(<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/announcing-the-economic-value-atlas-a-new-approach-to-regional-transportation-and-land-use-planning/" target="_blank">Tomer
et al.</a>). The Met Council created an open source, replicable instance 
of the tool in RShiny. Please scroll down to start using this tool. We suggest

## What this tool does

The Economic Value Atlas is a tool to help policymakers focus
investments in ways that will create access to family-wage jobs and
support growing industries.

<br> The tool will help verify and improve our understanding of the
economy by providing an interactive, visual display of variables that
tie back to a set of desired economic outcomes. It will also help
provide a more transparent public discussion about economic conditions
among the communities in the region and how we can build an inclusive
economy and expand access to opportunity.
